# attest-chain

## Dependencies
The major package requirements for this project (That I'm aware of) are:
- Node.js
  - https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
- geth
  - https://ethereum.github.io/go-ethereum/install/
- solc
  - http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html

Once those are installed you'll need to run `npm install` to pull down the
Node.js dependencies, and from there you can go a number of different ways.
If you'd like to avoid buying/mining ethereum you can create a local test
blockchain with either `make local-test-chain` or
`npm run-script createLocalTestChain` otherwise you can choose to configure things yourself to use the slow, expensive blockchain.

## Running
To start the server you can either execute `startServer.sh` or `npm start`, and after that you should have a real live server running in console mode for your development pleasure.

## Testing
run `node test.js` to run the test script
